# DevOverflow Client-side

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Installation and Setup

> [!NOTE]
> While you can run this project using npm, I highly recommend using [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) as your package manager, as it's faster and more efficient than `npm` or `yarn`.

1. If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it globally by running:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

2. Clone this repo:

```bash
https://github.com/devoverflow-project/client
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Now,just try it out.

_Have a wonderful day! âœ¨_
